## Answer these questions before you start doing the exercises
Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?

What were the main ideas from chapter 1:
    By teaching us about classes and objects by recreating them from scratch, we get a better understanding how objects work. Without it, we learn how we can interact with object and what to expect those results to be, but by recreating them, we better understand how the computer processes our inputs. This lets us better predict the functionality as well.

What questions did you have about the material in chapter 1? What did you find confusing?
    We were confused about when to use inheretance and polymorphism, and when to remake methods.

2B. It depends on the implementation, but we decided that lines could have perimeters and areas. We could not find anything on the internet, though. However, we think that in order to avoid conflicts, a line's perimeter should be twice its length and the area should be 0. We also think these could be both "None" but it depends on the implementation.

Part 2
What were the main ideas from chapter 4:
    The main takeaway was the idea of patterns and how to use to evaluate variables if they follow certain rules. We can also use the idea of pattern to check if out program works the way we need to. We can find commonalities in classes and move them to the parent class.

What questions did you have about the material in chapter 4? What did you find confusing
    Are null objects only used for comparasion?

1. We use the extra index when iterating to check if there is anything else after the end of the word.
