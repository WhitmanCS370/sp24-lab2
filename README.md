## Answer these questions before you start doing the exercises
Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?
The main idea from chapter 2 was the difference and relationship between objects, classes, and arguments. Furthermore, I found the idea of polymorphism to be important when talking about objects.

From chapter 4, pattern matching was the big idea. I found the design patterns Null Object and Chain of Responsibility to be highly important. 

* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
I'm still confused about the pattern Extract Parent Cass.
