## Answer these questions before you start doing the exercises
Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?
Ch2: We can implement classes using polymorphism to make our code easier to comprehend. This allows us to treat related classes interchangeably. Also, classes themselves are basically just dictionaries.
Ch4: Pattern matching is a good example of the chain of responsibility pattern in action. At each phase of matching, the rest of the string gets passed down the 'chain' for further matching.

* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
I am a bit confused about the specifics of how each of the matching algorithms work...
