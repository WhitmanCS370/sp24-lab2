## Answer these questions before you start doing the exercises
Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?

Chapter 2: We learned to implement classes using dictionaries, in hope of getting under-the-hood on how classes really work. It also touches on inheritence and sharing methods between classes.

* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?

Chapter 2: Why do it this way? Why learn how to implement objects using dictionaries instead of just using the object framework already in python?
