## Answer these questions before you start doing the exercises
Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from each chapter?
Ch. 1 The whole idea behind this chapter was constructing classes and objects in a way that dictionaries are used to reference parents and children for making more methods and objects.

Ch. 2 The second chapter talked about pattern matching and and in specific chain of responsibility where each matcher matches if it can then asks the next matcher in the chain to try to match the remaining texts. 


* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
Ch. 1 We were confused about how exactly dictionaries are used in OOP and why they are important. Ch. 2 In pattern matching, we found it hard to grasp the concept of globbing and how it all connects with each other.
